"""The stage-2 eval is only worth its numbers if its cases stay well formed.

`scripts/calibrate_skill_stage2.py` is run by hand against the live API, so nothing else in
this suite would notice if a case lost its expectation, named a skill this repo does not ship,
or if someone quietly deleted the four turns that want no skill at all — which are the only
ones where the two policies disagree on the small catalog.

These checks are offline: they read files and import the script, and never call Jev.
