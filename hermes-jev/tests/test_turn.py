"""The merged request: one Jev round trip for routing's questions and skill selection's stage 1.

Two things have to hold, and only the first is obvious:

1. **One request, not two.** Jev charges per request. Measured on 2026-09-21 against the live
   API: routing alone ~540 ms, skill-pick stage 1 alone ~647 ms, both together ~620 ms.
2. **The decision does not change.** The merged answers are handed to the same policy code
   (`route.decide(answers=...)`, `skillpick.pick(stage_one=...)`), so the tiers, the floors and
   the fail-open paths must come out identical to the two-call path. If they ever stop being
   identical, `test_the_merged_answers_give_the_same_decision_as_the_two_calls` fails.

And one that is not about speed at all: the privacy boundary does not move. A private profile,
a turn that looks sensitive, or routing configured to send features only means **no merged
request at all** — not a merged request with the text removed — because skill selection refuses
those turns outright. Those tests assert the transport was never called.
