"""Hermes Jev plugin: lets TypeSafe Jev take the cheap decisions off the agent's plate.

Uses only public plugin seams, so it survives `hermes update`:

* ``pre_llm_call``       once per fresh user turn: remembers the turn, and (if on) suggests a skill
* ``llm_request``        middleware: swaps the model for that turn, within the connected provider
* ``transform_llm_output`` optionally shows the one-line routing notice
* ``transform_tool_result`` (if on) screens web_search / web_extract results for injected instructions
* ``post_tool_call``       remembers which skills a session loaded, so a suggestion is never a repeat;
  with ``/jev vision shadow`` it also queues a local Jev-Omni answer to each decision-shaped
  ``vision_analyze`` question and logs how it compares, never changing the result (jevkit/omni_vision.py)
* tools + ``/jev``        memory filter, compaction selection, action chooser, status and switches
* ``pre_approval_request`` / ``post_approval_response``  the command-risk gate in SHADOW only:
  registered only when ``/jev gate shadow`` was set before the gateway started; observers that
  queue work and return at once, never a verdict (see jevkit/gate.py)

Everything fails open. If Jev is slow, down, unsure, or the turn looks private,
Hermes behaves exactly as it did before this plugin existed.
