"""Bounded GUI computer-use loop: cua-driver (MCP) + Jev.

The counterpart to jev_browser_agent.py for desktop surfaces. You own the
planner role; Jev only ever picks one id from a table you built. It never
writes coordinates, selectors or text.

  observe (cua-driver) -> element table -> jev choose -> one action -> observe

Usage:
  python3 jev_gui_agent.py --pid 26955 --window-id 46041 \
    --goal 'Open the Library page in YouTube Music' \
    --expect 'Library' --max-steps 12 --json

With --plan, a multi-step command is split once by a small text model (jevkit/plan.py)
and each step is either run directly (open an app, open an address, press a key, invoke a
menu, scroll, wait) or handed to the same loop as a one-action goal. --pid and --window-id
become optional, because a command that opens an app cannot know its window beforehand:

  python3 jev_gui_agent.py --plan \
    --goal 'Open System Settings, go to General and then open Storage' \
    --expect 'Storage' --json

A plan can come from jevkit's plan cache instead of the model (JEV_MEMO=on; the default only
records whether it would have matched). Every step is still observed, chosen, executed and
verified here either way, and a run that fails a step or ends unverified forgets its plan.

Exit codes: 0 verified, 4 unverified, 2 refused to start, 6 abstained.
