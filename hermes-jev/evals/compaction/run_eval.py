"""Does Jev selection make a handoff better? Measured here, not assumed.

The compaction skill says a handoff written from Jev's keep / summarize / drop digest
"stops losing the one line that mattered". Nothing in this repo ever tested that. Nous
Research tested a different Jev compaction design against real sessions and found its
ranking tied plain recency (hermes-agent PR 116246), so the claim needs its own numbers.

The method is theirs, scaled down: for each real transcript a model writes a recall exam
with gold answers, every arm builds a capsule, a model answers the exam from the capsule
alone, and a different model grades the answers. "Recovery" repeats the exam with one
search of the old session allowed, which is what a real next session can do.

Arms (each is one way to turn a transcript into the text a writer model sees):

  plugin_fallback   what ships when Jev is unavailable: every turn tagged [background]
  tail_plain        no Jev, a prompt that asks for exact values: the fair free baseline
  jev               what ships: compact.select -> compact.digest -> handoff_prompt
  recency_matched   Jev's keep/summarize/drop COUNTS, assigned by recency instead of by
                    Jev. Isolates Jev's judgement from the mechanism around it
  regex_keep        keep any turn holding an identifier-shaped string; free
  failopen          every turn "summarize", the last eight kept: what Jev being down gives
  *_v2              the same selections through digest_v2 below (keep lines placed first,
                    identifier sweep on clipped background). An experiment that lost
  full              the writer reads the whole dialogue: the ceiling for a capsule
  none              no capsule at all (only meaningful with recovery)

Nothing here prints or stores a key. Transcripts, questions and capsules are real session
content: they are written to --out, which must be outside the repo, and only numbers go
into the scorecard.
