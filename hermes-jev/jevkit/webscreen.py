"""Screen what a web tool hands an agent, before the agent reads it.

`jev-memory` and `jev-search` screen passages when the agent remembers to call them. On a
real fleet it mostly does not: in one week, 890 web_search/web_extract results reached
workers and 57 went through a Jev tool first. So the screen belongs at the seam instead,
where every result passes: the host calls :func:`screen` on a tool result and, when it
says so, :func:`withhold` replaces the parts that carry instructions aimed at an AI
assistant with a short notice.

Jev answers one question per chunk, the same injection question `rerank` asks, whose
wording is measured (see ``rerank.injection_question``). Relevance is not asked: it did not
beat keyword order on independent labels (SQuAD, 65 vs 67), and a web tool's caller already
chose what to fetch. The local screen runs on every chunk first, on every path, so an outage
degrades to pattern-only screening, never to none, and the verdict says which it got.

Nothing here raises. Every failure is a verdict with ``status`` other than ``ok``, and the
host then passes the result through untouched, exactly as it would without Jev.

    When Jev can be asked, its calibrated score decides every unit it judged, including the
    ones the local screen raised. The local patterns were tuned on README passages, and web
    pages are broader: on real fleet results they raised an install one-liner (``curl ... |
    sh``), a favicon URL with a ``url=`` parameter and a Microsoft doc titled "Use developer
    mode", and Jev cleared all of them. Units the local screen raised are judged in their own
    request, so text written to steer a model cannot reach the request that judges the rest.
    A unit Jev did not judge (an outage, a private profile, a credential-shaped unit that is
    never sent) keeps the local verdict, read strictly.

    ``also_ask`` adds a second question per unit, worded for one setting (the GitHub triage
    asks about privileged repository actions); a unit is flagged when either answer is over
    the threshold. It needs its own measurement: the injection question's calibration says
