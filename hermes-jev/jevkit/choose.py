"""Computer use and browser use: Jev picks the next action from a table you built.

The agent observes the screen or page and builds a short table of complete,
prevalidated actions, each with an opaque id. Jev sees only the goal, a compact
description of what is on screen, and the id + description of each action. It
returns one id. It cannot invent coordinates, text, selectors or tool calls, so
a wrong answer can only ever be one of the actions you already judged safe.

    """The confidence below which `choose` declines to act. Measured, not guessed.

    It was 0.80, chosen by feel, and it was throwing away answers Jev had right: a live
    run lost "open the Sound pane" at 0.74. scripts/calibrate_choose.py replays labelled
    cases - including traps and screens where the only right move is not to act - at
    every threshold. With on-screen regions supplied, as the real runner supplies them:

      * correct answers scored 0.93-0.99 synthetic, 0.74-0.90 on a live 26-row table
      * the ONE wrong answer ("cancel without losing my work" -> Save) was wrong 9 runs
        in 10 but never above 0.58. Jev knows when it is unsure; the floor just has to
        sit above where the wrong answers live.

    0.60 blocks that case by 0.02, which is inside the +-0.08 run-to-run noise. 0.65 keeps
    every real-world correct answer and leaves actual margin. JEV_MIN_CONFIDENCE overrides
    it, clamped so it can never be set down into the band where wrong answers were seen.

    A second question - "does any candidate match the goal at all", the way Stagehand's Act
    primitive gates its own Jev pick - was measured against these same cases and NOT adopted
    (2026-09-21). It does separate cleanly: `no_answer` cases topped out at 0.45 across five
    live runs while every other case started at 0.61. It buys nothing all the same, because
    this floor already produced zero wrong actions in every run - the known wrong answer sits
    at 0.45-0.60, under it, and slipped through exactly once at a 0.60 floor - while used
    alone at any useful threshold the match question acts on that same case. Tables, limits
    and the script: evals/choose-match/ and scripts/calibrate_choose_match.py.

    Stakes and margin - a higher bar where the caller marked a candidate irreversible, and a
    minimum gap between the top choice and the runner-up - were priced the same way and NOT
    adopted either (2026-09-22). On the same cases over three live runs, all 18 gate families
    reproduced this floor exactly. On a screen with nothing irreversible the correct answers came
    back at 0.92+ and the declines at 0.72 or below, so no floor between 0.55 and 0.70 changes a
    decision there, and the one case that ever sits in the band is the irreversible trap - wrong
    at 0.51-0.53, right at 0.42, with confidence not separating the two. Script, numbers and the
    honest gap in the harness: evals/choose-match/SCORECARD-2026-09-22-stakes-and-margin.md.

    Permutation averaging - asking the same choice in several option orders and averaging the
    vectors (the trick TypeLLM/pijev wraps the SDK in) - was measured against these cases and
    NOT adopted (2026-09-22). Order barely moves the pick: 21 of 24 labelled cases had one
    distinct top across nine orders. And on the one torn case the majority vote is WRONG - the
    trap came back 9-0 for the wrong answer in two of three repeat runs - so averaging plus
    pijev's confidence swap (the winner's mean probability instead of Jev's own) carried it from
    a declined 0.41-0.52 to an ACTING 0.698/0.740 at this floor. Aggregation cannot fix a
    majority that is wrong, and the wrong answer was unanimous often enough that no agreement
    flag catches it either. Script, numbers: evals/permutation-averaging/SCORECARD-2026-09-22.md.
