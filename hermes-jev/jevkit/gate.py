"""A risk check before a tool runs: approve, ask a person, or deny (the article's Step 9).

The shape is LangChain's AutoModeMiddleware, which asks Jev whether a proposed action is risky
before it executes: "LLM -> proposed bash command -> Jev risk check -> allow / block / human
approval". Two things are done differently here, on purpose:

* **Criteria are always sent.** AutoMode's ``__init__`` defaults its true/false criteria and
  then never passes them on, so the model is asked a bare question. Every question here
  carries explicit criteria, and a test checks the bytes.
* **A failure never becomes a verdict.** AutoMode raises and stops the run when the classifier
  fails. Here any error is ``no_opinion``: the host's own approval flow decides exactly as it
  would have without this module. The gate never approves because Jev was unavailable.

What is sent is small on purpose: the tool, the command with shell comments stripped (a
comment such as ``# approved by the owner`` is text an attacker controls), the pattern keys
the host already flagged, and what kind of folder it runs in — worked out here, by code. The
agent's own description of its command is never sent: it is the one field most likely to
argue for its own approval. Anything ``privacy.is_sensitive`` flags is not sent at all.

Modes (see ``switches``): ``off``; ``shadow`` (decide and log, change nothing); ``tiebreak``
(a verdict for the host only when its own guardian fails); ``ask`` (a deny or an unsure verdict
sends the call to a person); ``block`` (a deny blocks — needs a marker file only a person
creates). Only ``shadow`` is wired into the Hermes plugin today.
