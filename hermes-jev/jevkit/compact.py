"""Compaction and handoffs: Jev marks what survives, a text model only writes it up.

Jev cannot summarize. What it can do, in one fast request per 40 turns, is mark each turn
as something to carry forward word for word, to clip, or to drop. It judges a long turn on
its first and last 350 characters, redacted, and sees no other turn while it does.

What that is worth was measured (evals/compaction, seven real sessions, 104 questions):
Jev's marks beat the same number of marks handed out by recency, 11 questions to 4, so the
judgement is real. But a handoff written from the digest built on those marks recalled less
than one written from the plain tail of the same size, 4 to 15. The clipping costs more
than the judgement earns. Use `select` to choose turns when a budget forces a choice; do
not expect it to improve a handoff, and see `handoff.recovery_block` for what did.

CONFIDENTIALITY — these override the rules above wherever they conflict:
- This handoff is a BREADCRUMB, not a summary. Record only: the task, which classes of
  source were checked, what evidence is still missing, who owns or must approve it, and
  the next safe action.
- Never carry a person's name, an email address, a phone number, a street address, a
  document or file name, a message id, a link, an account or invoice number, or any
  payment, health or disability detail. Write "the customer", "the staff member", "the
  quote in the shared drive" instead.
- A business location IS an operational fact, not personal data. Keep a site, branch,
  city or depot by name when the work depends on it — "ship to Fort Walton, not Destin"
  must survive verbatim. Dropping it to "the approved location" destroys the only thing
  that sentence was for. The line is: a place a business operates from, yes; a place a
  person lives, no.
- This REPLACES the instruction to keep identifiers verbatim. Where a [KEEP VERBATIM]
  line contains an identifier of that kind, carry the decision it expresses and drop the
  identifier. "Call Jane Doe on 555-0134 before Tuesday" becomes "call the customer back
  before Tuesday" — the deadline survives, the person does not.
- Internal technical pointers — file paths on our own servers, branch names, commands,
  ports, error strings — are fine and should be kept.
- If following these rules would leave a section with nothing to say, write "nothing
  recorded" under it rather than reaching for detail you are not allowed to keep.
