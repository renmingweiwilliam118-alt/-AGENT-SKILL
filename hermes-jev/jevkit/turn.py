"""One Jev request for two decisions: how to route this turn, and which skill it needs.

A Hermes turn pays two round trips before the model runs — skill selection on the pre-call
hook, routing on the request hook. Jev charges per request, not per question, so the two are
asked together here and each answer is handed back to the module that owns its policy:
`route.decide(answers=...)` and `skillpick.pick(stage_one=...)`. Neither module's thresholds,
floors or fail-open paths change; only the number of round trips does.

Measured on 2026-09-21 against the live API with a 379-skill catalog, one turn:

| request | latency |
|---|---|
| routing's three questions alone | ~540 ms |
| skill-pick stage 1 alone (120 options) | ~647 ms |
| both in one request | ~620 ms |

What is deliberately **not** here: stage 2, the per-finalist verification. Its questions
depend on the stage-1 answer, so it stays a second request and its own decision.
