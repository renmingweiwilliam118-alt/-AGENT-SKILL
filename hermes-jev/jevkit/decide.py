"""One engine for every policy decision: ask Jev the policy's questions, apply its rules, log it.

This is the article's Steps 3, 4 and 6 as a single building block (@0xMorlex, "Jev
Engineering: How to Make AI Agent Loops 200x Faster in 10 Steps", 2026-09-19): one yes/no
question returns a probability; several questions about one state go in one request; the
surrounding code, not the model, turns the numbers into what happens next.

Code goes first. A policy's ``pre_rules`` read only ``facts`` the caller computed; when one
holds, the decision is ``source: "code"`` and no request is made. Every decision says where
it came from — ``code``, ``jev`` or ``fallback`` — so a report can count the calls code saved.

``decide`` never raises for anything Jev or the network does. Every way it can fail — no key,
a timeout, a malformed reply, a state that looks like it holds a secret, the daily budget
spent — returns the policy's ``on_error`` action with ``fallback_used: true``, and that action
is by construction what the caller would have done without Jev. A reply from a Jev version
other than the one the thresholds were tuned on is marked ``drift``; a live caller then gets
``on_drift`` (a shadow caller still gets the rule's answer, flagged, so the log keeps
measuring).
