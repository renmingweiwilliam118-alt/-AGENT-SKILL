"""Install Hermes Jev Skills for whichever agents live on this machine.

    python3 install.py                 # detect Hermes / Claude Code / Codex and install for each
    python3 install.py --check         # show what would happen, change nothing
    python3 install.py --uninstall

On Hermes it installs every plugin under hermes/plugin, the skills, and the scripts in
hermes/scripts; --uninstall removes those and nothing else.

The `jev` command is a symlink when supported, otherwise an installer-owned shell
launcher: one in ~/.local/bin for the person, one in the bin folder of every Hermes
home for the agents. The fallback pins this checkout and supports Git Bash on Windows
without Developer Mode; it does not copy bin/jev into a folder that cannot find jevkit.
A file called `jev` that this installer did not make is never replaced or removed.

It never asks for, reads or prints an API key. Connecting the key is a separate,
private step: `jev setup-key`.
