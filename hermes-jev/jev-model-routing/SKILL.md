# Model routing with Jev

Jev reads a turn and answers three questions in one ~0.4 s request: how hard is it, what kind of work is it, and would a mistake be costly. Code then walks your pool for that tier and specialty and takes the first model that fits (images, context size). You do not pick models by feel; you ask.

## On Hermes it is automatic

With the `hermes-jev` plugin enabled, each fresh user turn is routed once, before the first model call. Tool-loop follow-ups reuse that decision. Switches, per profile:

```
/jev                    status
/jev routing shadow     decide and log, but do not switch (start here)
/jev routing on         switch models
/jev routing off
/jev notice on          show "[Jev] medium · coding → kimi-k2.7-code · confidence 0.97" on routed replies
```

A plugin can swap the model, not the provider connection. On OpenRouter that still means every vendor (DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, Grok, Qwen, Gemini, GPT). If you run `/model` yourself, your choice wins and Jev stays out of the way.

For a Hermes `custom` provider, the plugin cannot infer the backing models.dev provider. It now keeps the current model and logs `custom provider needs an explicit provider_aliases.custom` instead of blaming an unrelated pool. If and only if that endpoint actually serves the pool's models, set `"provider_aliases": {"custom": "venice"}` (replace `venice` with the real pool prefix) in `routing.json`. Check the endpoint and every pool model before enabling routing; an alias is an operator assertion, not cross-provider discovery. This does not edit any live routing mode.

## Asking directly (any agent)

Before delegating a task or spawning a sub-agent, ask which model should get it:

```bash
jev route --prompt "<the task, in the person's words>" --current "<provider:model you are on>"
```

Use `model_id` from the reply. `routed: false` means stay where you are; `reason` says why. Relay `notice` if the person likes to see routing.

## Lanes: delegating a task, and every step after it

For work you hand to a sub-agent or worker, finish with the smallest model and lowest effort that still gets it right. Jev decides; it never writes code, patches or designs.

```bash
jev lane classify --task "<the work, in the person's words>"        # first lane + model/effort
jev lane step --task "..." --lane <lane> --attempt <n> \
    --run "<test cmd>" --run "<lint/typecheck cmd>" --scope "<path glob>"   # after each cycle
```

| Lane | Claude Code (subagent) | Hermes Kanban card (default map) |
|---|---|---|
| `small` | `jev-lane-small`: Haiku, low | `gpt-5.6-luna`, medium |
| `medium` | `jev-lane-medium`: Sonnet, medium | `gpt-6-sol`, medium (today's default) |
| `high` | `jev-lane-high`: Opus, medium | `gpt-6-sol`, medium |
| `escalate` | `jev-lane-escalate`: Opus, high | `gpt-6-astra`, high |

`jev lane targets --host hermes` shows the map in force; `<hermes root>/jev/lanes.json` (or `~/.config/jev/lanes.json`) overrides any field. The Hermes map was calibrated on one fleet's own history (see `docs/lanes.md`); re-measure yours with `jev lane replay-build` / `replay-report`.

- **One request, all questions.** `classify` asks the lane (with an `other` escape: work a person should see first), security sensitivity and underspecification together. Code applies the thresholds: a `small` pick needs 0.7 confidence; a `medium` pick below 0.5 goes to `high`; security ≥ 0.7 is at least `high`. `keep_current` means keep the model you had (do it yourself, or ask).
- **Code first.** A model the person named, two failed attempts, or your own security-path check decide without asking Jev.
- **Deterministic checks first.** `step` runs the tests, compiler, type checker and linter you name and reads `git diff`. A failing check is `retry` (and `escalate` once the same lane failed twice); files outside `--scope` are `retry`; unrun checks are `verify`; security files changed on small/medium are `escalate`. Jev is asked only what is left: is it implemented, is it in scope, what next.
- **Escalate one lane at a time, on evidence only.** `escalate` from the top lane returns `person`.
- **Complete is earned.** `complete` is refused (becomes `verify`, with `complete_refused`) unless the checks ran and passed and the diff stayed in scope. Say when a check failed; never hide it.
- Only the tail of each long check output goes to Jev. Never compact or filter the agent's own reasoning.
- Jev down: `classify` keeps the current model, `step` says `verify`.
- **Make `--run` a script, not a one-liner.** It runs under a shell, so pipes and `&&` work, but the evidence prints the command cut short and a reader cannot tell what passed. A small script that checks the exact commit and each exit code, and prints `ok:`/`FAIL:` per gate, keeps the evidence legible. Make sure it reads only this cycle's results: an earlier failed attempt left in the same log will fail (or pass) the wrong run.
- **Read-only work: `--no-changes-expected`.** For a review or report, say so; otherwise an empty diff reads as nothing done.
- **`escalate` with a decision still open means `person`.** After a review whose facts are verified but which leaves the owner a choice (a risk to accept, an approach to pick), a stronger model cannot settle it. Put the decision to the person rather than re-running the work a lane up.

On Hermes, `jev lane shadow` (from cron) classifies new Kanban cards and logs what it would choose; `/jev lanes shadow|on|off` is the switch and `<hermes root>/jev/LANES_OFF` wins. `on` sets the card's model and effort before dispatch; turn it on only after `jev lane shadow-report` shows fewer tokens at the same first-try success, and with the owner's yes.

## The pools

`jev models list` shows every model this machine can call (the models.dev catalog, filtered to providers you hold a key or login for) with price, context and abilities. Pools live in `~/.hermes/jev/routing.json` (or `~/.config/jev/routing.json`):

```json
{"tiers": {"simple": {"general": ["openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash"], "coding": ["..."]},
           "medium": {"general": ["..."], "coding": ["..."], "research": ["..."], "writing": ["..."], "vision": ["..."]},
           "hard":   {"general": ["..."], "coding": ["..."]}},
 "exclude": ["*:free"], "private_profiles": ["billing"], "mode": "redacted-text"}
```

- `jev models suggest --write` creates a first draft from price bands. Then edit: order matters, first fit wins.
- Specialties are `general`, `coding`, `writing`, `research`, `vision`. A missing specialty falls back to `general`. A pool never falls down a tier, only up.
- When the person names a model they like for something, put it first in that pool. Do not invent model ids: copy them from `jev models list --search <name>`.

## Guarantees you can rely on

- Hard is earned: it needs real probability mass on "substantial" or "expert" (0.6 by default), read from the per-level spread Jev returns, never from an averaged score.
- Unsure is not hard. An unsure answer about a harmless turn keeps the current model; about a risky turn it picks medium.
- Risk words (production, delete, migration, security, payment, legal…) set a floor of medium, however short the prompt. They do not buy the hard tier on their own.
- Jev judges the ask: a long turn is read as its opening plus, mostly, its end (`ask_chars`). Boilerplate in the middle is not what gets scored.
- Reasoning effort is off by default and only writes the standard `reasoning_effort` field when routing is `on`. Opt in with an exact provider:model capability map, for example `"effort": {"enabled": true, "levels": ["low", "medium", "high", "high"], "models": {"openrouter:your-verified-model-id": ["low", "medium", "high"]}}`. Replace the example ID with a model actually verified to accept those levels; `xhigh` is not presumed supported. The requested level must appear in the exact model's allowed list, and an existing `reasoning_effort` or `extra_body.reasoning` always wins. Shadow/off never mutate requests. The pick reuses the routing difficulty answer without another Jev call; unsupported or malformed configuration fails open. No fleet effort setting or live routing is activated by installation.
- Template turns are not routed: anything starting with a `skip_prefixes` entry (`[kanban]`, `[SESSION HANDOFF`…) or from a `skip_session_prefixes` session (`cron`) keeps the model its profile or job was configured with.
- Large context (strictly above `sticky_context_tokens`, ~32k by default): never switches to a cheaper model, because rebuilding the prompt cache costs more than it saves. If either model has no catalog price, it conservatively keeps the current model too. Cache keys include the exact side of this guard, not only a coarse context bucket.
- Opt-in effort routing cannot undercut the resolved routing tier: medium floors the difficulty bucket at routine, hard at substantial. An unsure kept decision also gets at least routine. A large-context keep preserves the resolved floor through `effort_tier` without triggering a model switch or escalation. Explicit caller effort and exact-model capability checks still win.
- Turns that look like they contain secrets, and any profile listed in `private_profiles`, send Jev only coarse features (length, code present, risk words), never text. Those turns, and a profile with `mode: features`, also opt out of the merged request below.
- Its three questions normally travel in the **same request** as skill selection's stage 1 (`jevkit/turn.py`), because Jev charges per request and not per question, and the connection underneath is pooled (a fresh TLS session per call used to be ~275 ms of the ~520 ms a decision cost). Measured live 2026-09-21/22: one question ~180-250 ms warm, and **1784 ms → 672 ms** per turn that needs both, 3 requests → 2. Each feature still reads its own answers through its own thresholds. `/jev merge_requests off` separates them again.
- Jev down, slow (2.5 s budget) or malformed: current model, no delay beyond the budget. An answer that contradicts itself — a spread that does not cover the options, mass that does not sum to one, a chosen option that is not the maximum, a score that disagrees with its own distribution — is refused as `invalid_response` and lands here too.

## Tuning

Decisions are logged without prompt text to `<hermes home>/logs/jev-decisions.jsonl`. Run in `shadow` for a day, read which tier real turns land in, then move models between pools. Change thresholds from your own traces, never from a hunch.
