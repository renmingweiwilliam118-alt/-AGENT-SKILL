"""Does skill selection's stage 2 earn its ~500 ms, or would stage 1 alone do?

Stage 1 ranks the whole catalog with one Choice per batch. Stage 2 is a second request:
`needs_skill` plus one Noul per finalist, and the plugin only acts on what stage 2 leaves
standing. Measured 2026-09-22, that second request costs about as much as the first, so the
question is what it buys.

This runs each labelled case live ONCE, keeps every raw stage-1 probability and stage-2
answer, and replays both policies offline:

    stage 1 + stage 2   what ships: the top verified skill, withheld if needs_skill is low
    stage 1 only        the highest-probability candidate above the shortlist floor

The number that matters is not accuracy but the two ways a suggestion fails: a WRONG
suggestion (the agent is sent to a procedure that does not fit) and a SPURIOUS one (a skill
offered for a turn that wants none). A missed suggestion is the quieter failure.

Cases are authored here on purpose: real fleet turns do not belong in a public repo, and an
authored case carries the expectation with it. The caveat travels with the numbers — the
expectations are one agent's judgement, so this measures agreement with a written intent,
not ground truth.
